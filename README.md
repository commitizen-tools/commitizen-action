# commitizen-action

Add [commitizen][cz] incredibly fast into your project!

## Features

- Allow prerelease
- Super easy to setup
- Automatically bump version
- Automatically create changelog
- Update any file in your repo with the new version

Are you using [conventional commits][cc] and [semver][semver]?

Then you are ready to use this github action! The only thing you'll need is the
`.cz.toml` file in your project.

## Usage

1. In your repository create a `.cz.toml` file (you can run `cz init` to create it)
2. Create a `.github/workflows/bumpversion.yaml` with the Sample Workflow

### Minimal configuration

Your `.cz.toml` (or `pyproject.toml` if you are using python) should look like
this.

```toml
[tool.commitizen]
version = "0.1.0"  # This should be your current semver version
```

For more information visit [commitizen's configuration page][cz-conf]

## Sample Workflow

```yaml
name: Bump version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  bump_version:
    if: "!startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'bump:')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Bump version and create changelog with commitizen"
    steps:
      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
      - id: cz
        name: Create bump and changelog
        uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Print Version
        run: echo "Bumped to version ${{ steps.cz.outputs.version }}"
```

## Outputs

| Name      | Description     |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `version` | The new version |

The new version is also available as an environment variable under `REVISION` or you can access using `${{ steps.cz.outputs.version }}`

## Using SSH with deploy keys

1. Create a [deploy key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys) (which is the SSH **public key**)
2. Add the **private key** as a [Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) in your repository, e.g: `COMMIT_KEY`
3. Set up your action

```yaml
name: Bump version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  bump-version:
    if: "!startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'bump:')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Bump version and create changelog with commitizen"
    steps:
      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          ssh-key: "${{ secrets.COMMIT_KEY }}"
      - name: Create bump and changelog
        uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@master
        with:
          push: false
      - name: Push using ssh
        run: |
          git push origin main --tags
```

## Creating a Github release

```yaml
name: Bump version

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  bump-version:
    if: "!startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'bump:')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Bump version and create changelog with commitizen"
    steps:
      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: "${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}"
      - name: Create bump and changelog
        uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@master
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          changelog_increment_filename: body.md
      - name: Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          body_path: "body.md"
          tag_name: ${{ env.REVISION }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Other actions are not triggered when the tag is pushed

This problem occurs because `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger other
actions [by design][by_design].

To solve it, you must use a personal access token in the checkout and the commitizen steps.

Follow the instructions in [commitizen's documentation][cz-docs-ga].

## I'm not using conventional commits, I'm using my own set of rules on commits

If your rules can be parsed, then you can build your own commitizen rules,
create a new commitizen python package, or you can describe it on the `toml` config itself.
